# Note to Shelf
Note To Sel is a toll that is supposed to act as a tool that you an use to take notes on the fly by simply calling the file("note.sh") and stating whether or not you want to add, break, list, or search your notes. this tool is entirely written in shill script. as of now the limitations of my tool is when creating notes you have to use the format [note.sh "add, bra, list, search" "file name"]. when using this tool keep in mind that you can't create multiple of the same note. Finally notes with this tool can be named with speicial characters EX:"@(#(&#))" could be a note of yours.


<!--

Create a shell script that functions as a command-line note-taking tool. This tool should help you quickly capture and organize thoughts, reminders, and tasks directly from the terminal.

## Requirements

- The script must support the following commands:
    - Add a new note: `note add "Your note text here"`
    - List all notes: `note list`
    - Search notes: `note search "keyword"`
- Implementation requirements:
    - Store notes in a text file with proper date/time stamps
    - Include error handling for all commands
    - Implement input validation
    - Add proper logging for debugging

## Testing Criteria

Your script will be tested against the following scenarios:

- Adding notes with special characters
- Proper file operations (read/write)
- Correct date/time formatting
- Search functionality accuracy
- Proper exit codes for success/failure

## Example Usage

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Add a note
$ ./note.sh add "Schedule dentist appointment"
Note added successfully

# List all notes
$ ./note.sh list
2025-01-06 12:04:06 - Schedule dentist appointment
2025-01-06 12:05:04 - Buy groceries

# Search notes
$ ./note.sh search "dentist"
2025-01-06 12:04:06 - Schedule dentist appointment
```
